Discord Hack Week Bot!
Made using the open source bot template of the github user agubelu:
https://github.com/agubelu/discord-bot-template

I made a maze game bot using the Python language.
The bot lets play through a randomly generated ascii maze of customizable size (between 8x8 to 36x36), using 3 buttons - turn left, turn right and move forward.
You also have the ability to quit the game in the middle using the "no entry" button.
Once you finish, the time of the completion of the maze is written on the screen in seconds.
The bot handles all acknowledged exceptions, and does not let a player press another player's maze buttons.

I have worked on the subject of maze generation before, but the functions needed absolute recoding because they were functioning properly nearly 10% of the times.
Originally, the maze display was supposed to be 3D and very limiting for the player - the vision would be first person.
But, the player would have the option of easy mode, allowing you to show the map while navigating the 3D space.
In addition, another thing that I wanted to implement but had no time for it is a time leaderboard for 8x8 mazes, 16x16 mazes, 25x25 mazes and 36x36 mazes
